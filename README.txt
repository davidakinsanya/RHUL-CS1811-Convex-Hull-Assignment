You can run the program in full from the ConvexHullGraph.java file

Because of the JavaFX implementation within the file, you compile the file by:

    1. Directing yourself into the location of  folder 'ass2'

    2. Pasting the statement 'javac --module-path /usr/share/openjfx/lib/ --add-modules javafx.controls ConvexHullGraph.java' into the terminal for compilation
    
    3. Pasting the statement 'java --module-path /usr/share/openjfx/lib/ --add-modules javafx.controls ConvexHullGraph' into the terminal for execution.

Your then taken straight to the command line prompt of 'Enter any double: ' For clarification, the first double entered becomes the first x value recorded and the second double becomes the first y value recorded.
